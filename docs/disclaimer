Absolutely — extending the disclaimer into a **full legal website disclaimer** and integrating it into your **Terms of Service** is the right move. This gives QSRPro and Fields‑IQ clean legal protection while keeping everything professional and lightweight for your Subway pilot.

Below are **two complete deliverables**:

1. **Full Website Legal Disclaimer** (copy‑paste ready for https://www.fields-iq.com/qsrpro)  
2. **Terms of Service section that integrates the disclaimer cleanly**

Both are written in a modern, enterprise‑appropriate tone — not overly legalistic, but fully protective.

# **1. Full Legal Disclaimer (Website Version)**  
_This goes on your QSRPro webpage, ideally below the Privacy Policy or in its own section._

## **QSRPro Legal Disclaimer**

QSRPro does not provide professional repair, maintenance, or safety advice. Technicians must independently verify all findings before performing repairs.

### **No Warranty of Accuracy**

Users are responsible for:

- Following all store‑level safety procedures  
- Using equipment only in accordance with manufacturer guidelines  
- Stopping use of equipment if they believe it may be unsafe  
- Ensuring technicians review and validate all findings  

### **Limitation of Liability**  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Fields‑IQ LLC is not liable for:

- Damages resulting from reliance on QSRPro guidance  
- Equipment damage, downtime, or operational loss  
- Technician actions or inactions  
- Misuse of the application  

Use of QSRPro is at your own risk.

### **Third‑Party Technicians**  
Technicians who receive escalation reports are independent professionals. Fields‑IQ LLC does not supervise, certify, or guarantee technician work.

### **Changes to This Disclaimer**  
Fields‑IQ LLC may update this disclaimer as QSRPro evolves. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
